Preferred order of work:
10) glossary/perk insights
11) virtual scrolling on displayed weapons
  - possible to load weapons into the list over time (as they are processed) instead of all at once?
    - is this valuable at all? once processed, the indexed db has everything cached so the only slow down may be the DOM manipulation
  - array of 50 (probably?) container objects for weapon items
  - array of equal length holding HTMLElement for each container
  - on every scroll event, check for any container that is 500px (maybe different value? depends on number of containers?)
    off screen and move it to the top or bottom, depending on direction off screen
    - also move weapon items into a "viewed item" list when they scroll into view
  - map of container position number -> weapon item to display (or null/undefined to not display anything)
  - IDs for containers?
  - can't just base it on position when using constant number of containers because then they'd be flipping
    back and forth between top and bottom if there's too many
  - track size, position of view box and containers?
  - only swap when required?
    - when there are too few elements (< 5?): below the view box when scrolling down, or above the view box when scrolling up
    - track number of containers above/below view box and swap when below threshold
12) Perk filters
13) Delay loading when searching, or maybe load in chunks, or load in the background if possible? 
14) styling cleanup:
  - put common values into variables in base.css
  - convert to using rem instead of px
15) compare section (not actually complete in d2gunsmith so gonna have to free ball that one)
  - ideas:
  - each weapon is 1 row
  - stats only display numbers
  - perks, intrinsic, origin, MW, and mod in a straight line on the right side
  - icon + name/type on left side
  - stats in middle
  - what should stat arrows display? green only if highest value in list of weapons being compared?

Unsure about order:
- Move constants into class/interface, add Destiny2GameData as a property to be cached (hopefully reduce bundle size)
- for collections filters - don't seem to include all possible weapons, e.g. multimach isn't in the iron banner filter. change this at some point
- add icons, collections for seasons before season of worthy
- selecting a masterwork on a weapon, then selecting a weapon that does not have that masterwork has no masterwork selected instead of the first one in the list
- convert as many ID comparisons, etc. as possible to hashes
- convert collections lists to enum instead of magic numbers
- convert rangefinder perk name to perk hash, as those are apparently stable
- convert Item Tier Index to hash, as those are stable
- better solution for dealing with enums from bungie-api-ts and isolatedModules?
- load background image after manifest has loaded to ensure it doesn't delay page load on low speed networks
  - the home page loads until the background fills in, then it transitions to the weapon page
- some perks showing up twice (e.g. vision of confluence, zaouli's bane)
- fix "include sunset" filter
- filter for adept weapons
- make use of inventory size stat
- elemental cap selector
- show that page is refreshing when game data is being reloaded
- ordering weapons by release date to the API (might have to be manual)
  - if picking limited scrolling for unfiltered weapon list, make sure to grab latest weapons somehow
  - I actually like the ordering as I have it now...
- glossary (will probably need this done manually anyway for the perk descriptions/tooltips)
- collections filters
- tab bar text isn't centered properly
- change PerkColumnNumber to something better
- reload speed calculator
- damage fall off calculator for the remaining weapon types
- exotic catalyst support

Research:
- make perk insights async loading - load when glossary is selected OR a weapon is selected?
- look into using the indexed DB as a proper DB - object store for each property on Destiny2GameData. see if improves read times
- sandbox perks - do they have any info we could want for things other than mods?
- if possible, some feedback from the URL -> weapon list so that the weapon in the URL gets loaded first?
- hashes for weapons do actually seem to be the same across languages... is that something I can rely on?
- look into precision damage stat, maybe can include that?
- look into weapon ready/stow stat?
- look into ADS stat?
