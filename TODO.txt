- like all the styling
- virtual scrolling/limited scrolling for weapon list? (prefer whatever loads faster)
- ordering weapons by release date to the API (might have to be manual)
- if picking limited scrolling for unfiltered weapon list, make sure to grab latest weapons somehow
- filters
- weapon viewer
  - extras (DIM integration, retired perks, comparisons integrations, damage falloff, reload speed)
  - MW (types + slider)
  - mods
  - perks (+enhanced and curated)
- glossary (will probably need this done manually anyway for the perk descriptions/tooltips)
- compare section (not actually complete in d2gunsmith so gonna have to free ball that one)
