- ordering weapons by release date to the API (might have to be manual)
  - if picking limited scrolling for unfiltered weapon list, make sure to grab latest weapons somehow

- glossary (will probably need this done manually anyway for the perk descriptions/tooltips)
- compare section (not actually complete in d2gunsmith so gonna have to free ball that one)
  - ideas:
  - each weapon is 1 row
  - stats only display numbers
  - perks, intrinsic, origin, MW, and mod in a straight line on the right side
  - icon + name/type on left side
  - stats in middle
  - what should stat arrows display? green only if highest value in list of weapons being compared?
- collections filters
- hide/set to false "show crafted bonus" when weapon cannot be crafted
- button to hide components on top of weapon panel so screenshot can be viewed
- cache certain options
- sort weapon filter buttons
- styling cleanup:
  - put common values into variables in base.css
  - convert to using rem instead of px
- tab bar text isn't centered properly
- elemental cap selector
- show that page is refreshing when game data is being reloaded

- tooltip for magazine still says mag stat instead of actual mag increase
- make use of inventory size stat
- look into precision damage stat, maybe can include that?
- look into weapon ready/stow stat?
- look into ADS stat?

- weapon viewer
  - extras (comparisons integrations, damage falloff, reload speed)
- process weapons into wrapper classes, including stats and display info
  - find a way to move stats to a more central location that all components that need stats can look at
    - right now, need to make modifications (e.g. crafted stat bonus) in multiple locations
    - this would probably be a part of a rework to process data from the API better
