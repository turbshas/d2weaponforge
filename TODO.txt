- like all the styling
- hide redacted/blacklisted entries
- urls for weapons - contains weapon hash + selected perk hashes
- optimize loading - load only weapon list first, then everything else in the background
- ordering weapons by release date to the API (might have to be manual)
- if picking limited scrolling for unfiltered weapon list, make sure to grab latest weapons somehow
- filters
- weapon viewer
  - extras (DIM integration, retired perks, comparisons integrations, damage falloff, reload speed)
  - buttons hover effect
  - perk/mod/weapon/stat tooltips
- glossary (will probably need this done manually anyway for the perk descriptions/tooltips)
- compare section (not actually complete in d2gunsmith so gonna have to free ball that one)
- required level for enhanced perks
- sunset weapons filter
- collections filters
- weapon archetype filters
- support for translations
- selecting curated perk then toggling enhanced makes the icon disappear
