- like all the styling
- hide redacted/blacklisted entries
- urls for weapons - contains weapon hash + selected perk hashes
- optimize loading - load only weapon list first, then everything else in the background
- ordering weapons by release date to the API (might have to be manual)
- if picking limited scrolling for unfiltered weapon list, make sure to grab latest weapons somehow
- filters
- weapon viewer
  - extras (DIM integration, retired perks, comparisons integrations, damage falloff, reload speed)
  - buttons hover effect
  - perk/mod/weapon/stat tooltips
- glossary (will probably need this done manually anyway for the perk descriptions/tooltips)
- compare section (not actually complete in d2gunsmith so gonna have to free ball that one)
- required level for enhanced perks
- sunset weapons filter
- collections filters
- weapon archetype filters
- support for translations
- selecting curated perk then toggling enhanced makes the icon disappear
- fix recoil direction indicator when RD > 96
- arrow indicator for stats
- idea for comparison page:
  - each weapon is 1 row
  - stats only display numbers
  - perks, intrinsic, origin, MW, and mod in a straight line on the right side
  - icon + name/type on left side
  - stats in middle
  - what should stat arrows display? green only if highest value in list of weapons being compared?
- create an ISelectedPerk that tracks info about the selected perk like if enhanced is used
- fix backup mag - it currently just does +30 to the mag (and mag perks)
- weapon mag size caps
- find a way to move stats to a more central location that all components that need stats can look at
  - right now, need to make modifications (e.g. crafted stat bonus) in multiple locations
  - this would probably be a part of a rework to process data from the API better
- hide/set to false "show crafted bonus" when weapon cannot be crafted
- check out the traitIds property on DestinyInventoryItemDefinition for multi-language support
- display RPM on appropriate weapons
